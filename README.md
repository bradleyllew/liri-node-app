# liri-node-app

This is Liri -  LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

#LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.

#Liri uses:
    *Node-Spotify API
    *Axios
    *OMDB API
    *Bands In Town API
    *Moment
    *DotEnv

#Liri works by retrieving data, using Axios requests from the above APIs.

#Please see the screensshots/gifs/videos for an example of how Liri works.
